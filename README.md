# AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System

## Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis System** is a machine learning-based application designed to assist in medical diagnoses. It utilizes various machine learning models like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to classify medical data and provide predictions based on input features. The application is designed to be user-friendly and is deployed using **Streamlit** for interactive web-based interfaces.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** The system handles missing data, performs feature scaling, and splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes machine learning models such as:
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluates models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **User Interface:** Deployed with **Streamlit** to allow real-time interaction with the model for predictions.
- **Medical Dataset:** The system uses an anonymized dataset to train models for medical diagnosis.
